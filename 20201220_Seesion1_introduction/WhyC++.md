#C++ is faster than java and C# 
mostly used in application which are directly related to hardware & in gaming engine
example of gaming engine unity, unreal, forstbyte etc.
in java and C# "virtual machine" convert the object file into machine understandable code at runtime (time taking)
think of virtual machine as a personal translator who books for you

C++ can directly run the machine code on target platform after executable file is created.
think of C++ as buying translated books instead of personal translator.

#Flow of execution of C++ and C program
editor-> preprocessor (pre preprocessed code)-> compiler (object code .o file)-> linker/loader (add other library files)-> executable file (a.exe/ a.out)
